This is a small package to visualize a graph corresponding to an
abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Julia expression. It uses the `TikzGraphs.jl`
package to do the visualization.

## Usage

The package is designed to be used within the IJulia notebook.

The simplest usage is `@tree <EXPRESSION>`, where `<EXPRESSION>` represents any
Julia expression, for example
```
@tree x^2 + y^2
```
which gives the following output:

![example_tree](example_tree.png)

See [this notebook](examples/TreeView%20usage.ipynb) for usage examples.

## Installation prerequisites

You will need to have `LaTeX` installed on your system, and install the `pdf2svg` utility; see
the [`TikzGraphs.jl` documentation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sisl/TikzGraphs.jl/blob/master/doc/TikzGraphs.ipynb) for details.
